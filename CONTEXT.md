# Tennis Scanner Daily

## Purpose

This file stores workflow, operating rules, restart behavior, and maintenance instructions for this workspace.

Read this file first at the start of every new thread or restart. Then read the editorial memory.

## Memory Split

- this file is the workflow and operations source of truth
- `CONTENTS.md` is the editorial, source, and presentation source of truth
- keep project documentation in English
- update this file when workflow, automation, runtime behavior, or developer conventions change
- update `CONTENTS.md` when coverage, writing style, source priorities, or page structure change
- mirror user-facing workflow changes in `README.md`

## Startup Rule

- at the start of every new thread or restart, read this file first and then `CONTENTS.md` before replying or running commands
- this rule applies even to short or casual prompts

## Working Rules

- the main output is HTML, not a chat report
- the normal deliverable is `editions/YYYY-MM-DD.html` plus `editions/latest.html`
- after a successful scan, a short confirmation is enough unless the user asks for more
- prefer small, durable rules over brittle prompt micromanagement

## Core Commands

- treat short prompts such as `scan`, `edition`, `refresh`, and `help` as scanner commands
- `scan` means: fetch the current ATP singles card, enrich it with ATP data plus current reporting, and update the two edition files
- internal runner shortcut: `runner-scan`
- when handling `runner-scan`, do the scan work directly in the current session
- never call `run.sh` from inside `runner-scan`
- never spawn a nested runner from `runner-scan`

## Runtime Rules

- use `https://tennis.egelberg.se` as the canonical runtime backend
- fetch the current match card and bookmaker prices from `https://tennis.egelberg.se/api/oddset`
- use ATP and reliable current reporting only as enrichment
- use bookmaker odds only for matches that have not started yet
- `editions/latest.html` may be read to preserve layout, but it must never be used as a reason to skip regeneration
- every scan run must generate a fresh edition from live sources
- every scan run must rewrite the visible snapshot timestamp and output HTML

## Preferred ATP Endpoints

- `GET /api/oddset`
- `GET /api/player/lookup?query=...`
- `GET /api/players/odds/:playerA/:playerB?surface=...`
- `GET /api/players/head-to-head/:playerA/:playerB?limit=10`
- `GET /api/events/calendar`
- `GET /api/flags/:code.svg`
- `GET /api/meta/endpoints`
- `GET /api/meta/schema.sql`
- `POST /api/query` only when the normal endpoints are not enough

## Rendering Rules

- `template.html` is the main editable layout file
- generated editions must remain fully standalone HTML files
- keep styling inline unless the user asks otherwise
- the page theme may follow the dominant surface on the card
- support light and dark mode when practical, but do not let theme work destabilize the scan flow
- prefer ATP SVG flags over emoji
- render match-title flags as circular slots using `background-image:url(...)`
- if a flag asset is missing, keep the same slot and rely on the backend fallback SVG
- the `Odds` block may show `Oddset`, `TA`, and `Vitel`
- keep the odds logic internally consistent: if the comparison row stays tied to `Vitel`, then both that row and the `Spelidé` text must be based on `Vitel vs Oddset`
- do not show a `Codex` odds row in the edition

## Scheduling And Run Script

- `run.sh` should default to one scan and exit
- `run.sh --publish` is optional
- `run.sh --daily HH:MM` enables the long-lived daily schedule in `Europe/Stockholm`
- `run.sh` should call `runner-scan` rather than embedding a long literal prompt

## Restart Reliability

- keep `AGENTS.md`, this file, and `CONTENTS.md` in the project root
- if either memory file is renamed, update `AGENTS.md`
- prefer updating the memory files over hard-coding workflow rules elsewhere
