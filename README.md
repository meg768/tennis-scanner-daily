# Tennis Scanner Daily

Tennis Scanner Daily is a Codex-driven workspace for producing a daily HTML edition centered on the current ATP singles card from Svenska Spel Oddset.

The goal is not to build a generic tennis news page or a pure odds screen. The workflow starts from the live match card, then enriches each matchup with ATP database history, head-to-head context, form, overall level, event-surface context, and current reporting such as injuries or recent withdrawals.

## What This Project Is For

- publish one daily HTML edition for the current ATP singles card
- cover all ATP singles matches on Oddset
- exclude doubles, WTA, and Challenger matches
- combine bookmaker pricing with ATP database context
- use current web reporting for injury and availability context that the database does not contain
- present the result in a readable newspaper-style layout

## Runtime Backend

In normal runtime, this project should talk to the hosted ATP HTTP service directly.

- the ATP service is the real backend dependency
- the intended runtime base URL is `https://tennis.egelberg.se`

## Core Workflow

The edition should be built in this order:

1. Fetch the current ATP singles card from the Oddset-backed ATP feed
2. Resolve tournament and surface context
3. Enrich each match with ATP rankings, head-to-head, form, and model context from the hosted ATP service
4. Check current web reporting for injuries, withdrawals, absences, or other material updates
5. Write one HTML edition in Swedish
6. Save it to both:
   - `editions/YYYY-MM-DD.html`
   - `editions/latest.html`

## HTML Edition

The page is intentionally static:

- `template.html` is the base layout file
- `editions/YYYY-MM-DD.html` stores the dated edition
- `editions/latest.html` stores the current edition

The design is meant to stay focused on the match list itself. It should still work well on both desktop and mobile.
The generated HTML can also carry the dominant surface theme in a fully self-contained way and follow the viewer's light/dark system preference without needing any external app runtime.

## Quick Prompts

Typical prompts in this workspace:

- `scan`
- `generate today's edition`
- `refresh the html`
- `help`

Expected behavior:

- `scan` or `generate today's edition` should update the local HTML edition files
- a normal scan should not create extra helper scripts or new project source files
- `help` should explain how the match list is sourced and how the edition is assembled
- this project uses one command model only; there is no separate user-mode versus developer-mode command split

## Sources

Normal source mix:

- Svenska Spel Oddset for the current ATP singles card and bookmaker odds
- `https://tennis.egelberg.se` for rankings, head-to-head, schedule context, model odds, and read-only SQL access
- ATP Tour and tournament pages for official context
- Reuters and other reliable reporting for current injury and availability news

Important interpretation rule:

- do not treat clay, hard, or grass as the default narrative lens of the whole edition
- use the actual event surface as matchup context when relevant
- if the ATP dataset offers useful overall or surface-specific ELO/rating signals, they are valid supporting evidence and may be shown in the edition

## ATP Service Endpoints

The ATP service documents itself now.

- `GET /api/meta/endpoints`
  Returns machine-readable metadata for the service endpoints, including method, params, query usage, and payload notes.

- `GET /api/meta/schema.sql`
  Returns the raw database schema SQL, including comments, functions, procedures, and DDL context.

For this project, treat those two metadata endpoints as the canonical documentation layer rather than maintaining a second full endpoint reference here.

## ATP Service Notes

- canonical base URL: `https://tennis.egelberg.se`
- scanner-relevant core endpoints:
  `GET /api/oddset`
  `GET /api/player/lookup`
  `GET /api/players/odds/:playerA/:playerB`
  `GET /api/players/head-to-head/:playerA/:playerB`
  `GET /api/events/calendar`
  `POST /api/query`
- canonical service docs:
  `GET /api/meta/endpoints`
  `GET /api/meta/schema.sql`
- `/api/query` is read-only by design, but it still exposes broad database reads and should stay private
- if we want the exact same config locally and on the Pi, the scanner should target these HTTP endpoints directly

## Automation

The repo includes a `run.sh` runner for scans.

- `./run.sh`
  Runs one scan and exits.

- `./run.sh --publish`
  Runs one scan, publishes `editions/` to the web root, and exits.

- `./run.sh --daily 09:00`
  Waits for the next `09:00` in `Europe/Stockholm`, then runs once per day at that time.

- `./run.sh --publish --daily 09:00`
  Publishes after each daily run and keeps the process alive inside PM2.

Internally, `run.sh` sends the short command `runner-scan` to Codex. That means scan behavior should normally be changed in the project memory rather than by editing a long embedded shell prompt.
`runner-scan` is meant to execute the scan directly in the active Codex session. It must not call `run.sh` again or start a nested runner process.
`runner-scan` should stay narrowly focused during a live scan: read `template.html` and `editions/latest.html`, fetch the current card and player context from `https://tennis.egelberg.se`, add current reporting for the specific matches on the card, then write the two edition files. It should avoid broad repo searching or wandering through unrelated historical files during a normal scan.
`runner-scan` should also use the documented ATP service endpoints directly. It should not probe `https://tennis.egelberg.se/`, inspect the frontend app, or scrape bundled JavaScript assets just to rediscover endpoints that are already part of the project memory.
To keep Pi scans stable, `runner-scan` should keep tool output compact. It should prefer filtered endpoint reads and small excerpts over dumping full HTML, full JSON payloads, or large schema responses into the session.

For the Pi runner, `run.sh` should use `codex exec --sandbox danger-full-access` rather than `--full-auto`. In practice, the narrower nested sandbox can block DNS or outbound HTTP for `tennis.egelberg.se` and Oddset even when plain shell networking works on the machine.

## Change Log

- 2026-04-06: Initial tennis-scanner-daily project scaffold added with project memory, HTML template, and edition workflow.
- 2026-04-07: Locked `runner-scan` to the documented ATP endpoints so Pi scans do not waste time rediscovering APIs from the hosted frontend bundle.
- 2026-04-07: Added compact-output rules for `runner-scan` so Pi scans do not bloat the nested Codex session with full HTML, payload, or schema dumps.
- 2026-04-07: Documented the actual endpoint payload shapes from `tennis.egelberg.se`, especially the live contracts for `/api/oddset`, `/api/player/lookup`, `/api/players/odds`, `/api/players/head-to-head`, `/api/events/calendar`, and `/api/query`.
- 2026-04-07: Removed the inherited user-mode versus developer-mode split from this project and simplified command handling to one workflow.
